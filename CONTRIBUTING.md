Good first PRs (no code required):
1. Add 1 curated learning link (with 1-line why it matters)
2. Add 10 evaluation questions to the Eval Test Set template (include expected behavior)
3. Improve clarity of templates (AI Launch Card / README)

What NOT to add:
- Personal data (phone numbers, Aadhaar/PAN, email lists, etc.)
- Copyrighted images (memes/cartoon scans) unless licensed
